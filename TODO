How to run GenerateRunTests?
  / Makefile to update when out of date, cabal Setup hooks to run make.
  / Like Makefile, but a shell script that does the same thing.
  / Use Setup hooks directly.  Does cabal know how to only rebuild when
    necessary?
  * HSpec uses a -pgmF program to generate the module.  But I think it runs
    every single time you build tests.  Of course, maybe that's actually pretty
    fast.
    . pgmF args: OrigSourceName.hs input.hs output.hs

Interpret the output
  . I need the equivalent of test/run_tests.
  . Can I embed that logic in RunTest itself?  The problem is I want to write
    to stdout, and then check that stdout.  It's hard to do that when cabal is
    redirecting stdout.
